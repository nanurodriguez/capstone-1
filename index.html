    <h2>Service</h2>
    <h3>Porto Alegre North Mission</h3>

            I served on a mission in Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil. My role as a missionary of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints 
            was meaningful. I will carry The experiences and skills I learned as a missionary throughout my life.
            <br/>
            I had the privilege to serve as a leader of 40 young women who were also serving a mission in 7 different regions of
            the state of Rio Grande do Sul. This period of time serving the church and its members allowed me to open my mind and my heart
            to people and understand how to be a better human.
