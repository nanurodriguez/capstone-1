<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I am from Argentina but currently live in the US. I am a fun and creative
  person who is passionate about technology. I started my Software Engineer
  career development about 5 years ago at BYU Idaho and I am thrilled to announce that I will 
  be graduating with a bachelor's degree in software development in 2026.

<p>
  My hobbies are sewing (dresses, jackets, and other apparel clothing), working out, and playing pickleball.
  I am also practicing Chinese and Italian. I love learning other languages so every week I try to learn a little
  from a other cultures.
</p>

<p>I am an entrepreneur who always thinks outside the box to make my business grow. I am building my portfolio in 
  web development and preparing myself to apply to the Software development Dropbox internship that will happen next
  year.
  I cannot wait to finish my degree and show the world what I can do!

<p>Why Web Development? As a little kid, I was fascinated by computers. When I was 11 years old, my dad brought two old computers
  he found to our home, they did not work so my siblings and I had this crazy idea about building out a new one from those two computers and so we did. 
  After four months of hard work, we finally were able to get to work one of them by adding extra parts that were needed for it to work.
  It's alive! ‚ò†Ô∏èüî©‚ö°Ô∏èüßü‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è I was so happy to see it work that we decided to test it out with a video game that night.
  I kept learning how to use a computer and its applications and kept thinking that someday I would be one of those engineers that built 
  those programs or applications to make the computer work. 
  This is where I am now, on this path to becoming a recognized software developer...
